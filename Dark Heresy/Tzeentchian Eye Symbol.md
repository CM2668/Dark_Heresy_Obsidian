An odd warp symbol painted in blood and shaped like an eye. Gazing at this symbol will give onlookers an "odd" feeling as well as inducing vertigo.

While the symbol itself is mostly harmless it can and should be disable by breaking one of the lines making up the eye. If possible, catch whoever made the symbol and execute them for heresy.
