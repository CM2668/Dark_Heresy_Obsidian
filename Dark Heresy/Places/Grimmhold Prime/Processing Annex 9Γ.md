A section of processing facilities and manufactorums near The Long Drop in [[Hive Carmina Paradiso]].

This is the site of a factory riot that the [[182nd Cadian]] sent a contingent to quell. The soldiers failed to report back, with their last message being cut off vox chatter.

The agents got to the site and found evidence of a fight and investigate further leading them to finding first and second generation [[Gene Stealers]] in drug running tunnels underneath the annex.
