The sole settlement on [[Grimmhold Prime]]. Hive Carmina Paradiso is a walled city without any building outside the walls and the forest cut back a few hundred yards.

As with all hive cities, the surface is one of the poorer areas of the city. This one is infested with gangs that brazenly display their enforcers in the streets.

People new to the hive might notice [[Turus Doctrina]] first. A tower dedicated to scientific research and development. It is also the most heavily defended spot in the hive.

Another notable feature of the surface level of Hive Carmina Paradiso is [[The Long Drop]], a half-kilometer wide hole that goes straight to the sump.
