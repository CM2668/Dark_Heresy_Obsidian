Blue-
Purple Tzeentch(?) dust lining vents
No dents or scortch marks on doors, doors peeled open like a sardine can
Cloaked and masked people appeared out of "nowhere"
Took rare materials and gene codes
Translucent people, armored
On the way out the figures walked to the doors and the doors just "opened"
