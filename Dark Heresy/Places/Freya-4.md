An "Imperial" ice planet that was the location of an Adeptus Mechanicus dig site. The Mechanicus were unearthing ruins and artefacts. The ruins are a Nekron Tomb that was starting to awaken from the Mechanicus' interference.

Due to a timely intervention by agents of the Inquisition and well as help from the Crimson Fists, the awakening of the tomb was disrupted.

The Grand Magos in charge of the dig and his underlings were tried by the agents of the Inquisition, found guilty of heresy, and sentence to death.

For the agents, this was meant only to be a layover on their way to rendezvous with the 182 Cadian on Grimmhold Prime
