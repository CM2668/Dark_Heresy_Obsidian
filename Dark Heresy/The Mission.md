[[The Agents]] of [[Inquisitor Stracken]] were sent to "reinforce" the [[182nd Cadian]]. There was a layover on [[Freya-4]].

As part of the 182nd, the agents are acting as commissars and are allowed to talk and travel as they see fit. However, should the agents wish to kill anybody or destroy anything, they shall need sufficient reason.

There is some form of rot in [[Hive Carmina Paradiso]] that the agents are to investigate and remove.

The agent's liaison into the 182nd is [[Sgt Rodrick Keel]], he supplied them with uniforms and a briefing. Once a part of the 182nd, the agents were told of a factory riot happening in Processing Annex 9Î“ near The Long Drop. There are missing soldiers and a cut-off vox message mentioning some kind of creature on the ceiling. At the site of the riot, the agents found evidence of a [[Tzeentch Cult]] nearby.
